This is a relatively simple bot which takes a copy command submitted via XMPP ("Botname, copy /foo/bar to /baz/quux") and copies the former file to the latter location (and new filename, optionally).  This seems like a fairly simple and dumb bot, and it is in many ways.  I wrote it as an example of a system utility bot, the uses of which are limited only to your imagination.

As always, `copy_bot.py --help` will display the most current online help.
