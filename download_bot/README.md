This is a bot which takes URLs submitted via XMPP ("Botname, download https://example.com/foo.pdf") and tries to download it to the local server, putting it in a directory specified in the configuration file.  If you have a propensity to grab a lot of files to read later this is likely a useful tool for you.

As always, `download_bot.py --help` will display the most current online help.
