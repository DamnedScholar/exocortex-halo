# The name of the bot (in the username= stanza, the 'botname' part) has to go
# in the block header below this comment.  That's what tells the bot which
# parts of the file belong to it.  It's an idiosyncracy of Python's
# ConfigParser module.  This also means that, in theory, a fleet of Exocortex
# bots can share a config file.  I don't recommend this because it makes things
# really messy.  This also means that there can be a single config file template
# for every bot subtype, and they'll ignore configuration directives that they
# aren't programmed to recognize.
